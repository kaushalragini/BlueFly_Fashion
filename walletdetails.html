            <h1>Refund policy</h1>
            <h3>GENERAL POLICY</h3>
            <p>
              Returns must be in their original, unused, and undamaged condition
              with all tags attached and all packaging included. Return time
              frames are either 14 days or final sale; this is indicated in each
              item's description located on the product page. Pieces sent back
              after the return period or without original packaging and the
              security tag attached, will not be refunded. Our system prevents
              prepaid shipping labels and return authorization forms from being
              created past the returns window. Be advised that all returns have
              a 7 day shipping window from the day the RMA is assigned. Shipping
              charges are not refundable. *Important Note: Late returns will not
              be accepted past their indicated returns period and no refund will
              be issued.
            </p>

              we may transfer or disclose your personal information to a
              purchaser or prospective purchaser, who may collect, use and
              disclose such information for the purposes of evaluating the

              bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or
              assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of

            <h3>BLUEFLY</h3>
            <p>Last updated: Aug. 31, 2022</p>
            <p>
              The BLUEFLY mobile message service (the "Service") is operated by
              BLUEFLY (“BLUEFLY”, “we”, or “us”). Your use of the Service
              constitutes your agreement to these terms and conditions (“Mobile
              Terms”). We may modify or cancel the Service or any of its
              features without notice. To the extent permitted by applicable
              law, we may also modify these Mobile Terms at any time and your
              continued use of the Service following the effective date of any
              such changes shall constitute your acceptance of such changes. By
              consenting to BLUEFLY’s SMS/text messaging service, you agree to
              receive recurring SMS/text messages from and on behalf of BLUEFLY
              through your wireless provider to the mobile number you provided,
              even if your mobile number is registered on any state or federal
              Do Not Call list. Text messages may be sent using an automatic
              telephone dialing system or other technology. Service-related
              messages may include updates, alerts, and information (e.g., order
              updates, account alerts, etc.). Promotional messages may include
              promotions, specials, and other marketing offers (e.g., cart
              reminders). You understand that you do not have to sign up for
              this program in order to make any purchases, and your consent is
              not a condition of any purchase with BLUEFLY. Your participation
              in this program is completely voluntary.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not charge for the Service, but you are responsible for all
              charges and fees associated with text messaging imposed by your
              wireless provider. Message frequency varies. Message and data
              rates may apply. Check your mobile plan and contact your wireless
              provider for details. You are solely responsible for all charges
              related to SMS/text messages, including charges from your wireless
              provider.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may opt-out of the Service at any time. Text the single
              keyword command STOP to +18337070811 or click the unsubscribe link
              (where available) in any text message to cancel. You'll receive a
              one-time opt-out confirmation text message. No further messages
              will be sent to your mobile device, unless initiated by you. If
              you have subscribed to other BLUEFLY mobile message programs and
              wish to cancel, except where applicable law requires otherwise,
              you will need to opt out separately from those programs by
              following the instructions provided in their respective mobile
              terms. For Service support or assistance, text HELP to
              +18337070811 or email privacy@bluefly.com. We may change any short
              code or telephone number we use to operate the Service at any time
              and will notify you of these changes. You acknowledge that any
              messages, including any STOP or HELP requests, you send to a short
              code or telephone number we have changed may not be received and
              we will not be responsible for honoring requests made in such
              messages. The wireless carriers supported by the Service are not
              liable for delayed or undelivered messages. You agree to provide
              us with a valid mobile number. If you get a new mobile number, you
              will need to sign up for the program with your new number. To the
              extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that we will not be
              liable for failed, delayed, or misdirected delivery of any
              information sent through the Service, any errors in such
              information, and/or any action you may or may not take in reliance
              on the information or Service. We respect your right to privacy.

              see our Privacy Notice. Changes to This Privacy Policy We reserve
              the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please

              changes to this policy, we will notify you here that it has been
              updated, so that you are aware of what information we collect, how
              we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we use and/or

            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>
              Because Bluefly uses some of the most sophisticated commercially
              available security software, it is extremely unlikely that any
              personal information that you transmit to us will be
              misappropriated. In the rare instance that an unauthorized person
              obtains your credit card information and uses it, by federal law,
              you are only liable for the first $50. In any instance where you
              have discovered or suspect fraud, you need to contact your credit
              card companies immediately.
